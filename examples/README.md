# Running the examples

To run examples, make sure you have a mnemonic and a network set.

```bash

export MNEMONIC="mnemonic words"
export NETWORK="network" # dev, qa, test, main -> default is dev
```

- Go to the examples directory `cd yaml/virtual_machine`
- Run the example `make run`
- To cleanup the resources that you created `make destroy`
